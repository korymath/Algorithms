/**
 * Give you an integer array (index from 0 to n-1, where n is the size of this
 * array)ï¼Œfind the longest increasing continuous subsequence in this array. (The
 * definition of the longest increasing continuous subsequence here can be from
 * right to left or from left to right)
 *
 * Have you met this question in a real interview? Yes
 *
 * Example
 *
 * For [5, 4, 2, 1, 3], the LICS is [5, 4, 2, 1], return 4.
 *
 * For [5, 1, 2, 3, 4], the LICS is [1, 2, 3, 4], return 4.
 *
 * Note
 *
 * O(n) time and O(1) extra space.
