/**
 * Given a list of two-dimensional rectangles, compute the area of their union.
 * For example, the union of the three rectangles shown in the figure below:
 *
 * cover an area of 35 units.
 *
 * The list of rectangles will be given as a vector <string>, where each element
 * describes one rectangle.  Each string will be formatted as 4 space-separated
 * integers with no leading zeros, giving the coordinates of the left, bottom, right,
 * and top of the rectangle (in that order).
 *
 * The three rectangles shown above would be given as:
 *
 *
 *
 *     { "1 3 5 6",
 *       "3 1 7 5",
 *       "4 4 9 7" }
 *
 * CONSTRAINTS
 *
 * - rectangles will contain between 1 and 3 elements, inclusive.
 * - Each element of rectangles will be formatted as described in the problem statement.
 * - For each rectangle, the left coordinate will be less than the right coordinate and the bottom coordinate will be less than the top coordinate.
 * - All coordinates will be between 0 and 20000, inclusive.
 *
 * EXAMPLES
 *
 * 0)
 * { "200 300 203 304" }
 *
 * Returns: 12
 *
 * A single rectangle with area 12.
 *
 * 1)
 * { "0 0 10 10",
 *   "20 20 30 30" }
 *
 * Returns: 200
 *
 * Two disjoint rectangles, each of area 100.
 *
 * 2)
 * { "0 500 20000 501",
 *   "500 0 501 20000" }
 *
 * Returns: 39999
 *
 * These two rectangles intersect at a single point.
 *
 * 3)
 * { "4 6 18 24",
 *   "7 2 12 19",
 *   "0 0 100 100" }
 *
 * Returns: 10000
 *
 * The third rectangle completely overlaps the first two.
 *
 * 4)
 * { "1 3 5 6",
 *   "3 1 7 5",
 *   "4 4 9 7" }
 *
 * Returns: 35
 *
 * This is the example from the problem statement.
 *
 * 5)
 * { "0 0 20000 20000",
 *   "0 0 20000 20000",
 *   "0 0 20000 20000" }
 *
 * Returns: 400000000

     * problem from the simplest case with only two regions, A and B, where the
     * second region/box can be treated as an imaginary union of all the remaining
     * boxes except box A.
     *
     * "I" denotes the intersection area of two boxes.
     *
     * We can visualize the recursive calling into a tree, where at level i it is of
     * 2^i computation cost (notice that box array input (2) and (3) are of the same
     * length). So the time complexity is O(2^n).
