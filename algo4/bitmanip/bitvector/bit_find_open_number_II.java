     * There are a total of 2^32, or 4 billion, distinct integers possible (and 2^31 non-negative
     * integers). We only have 10 MB of memory, which is 2^20 * 10 bytes.
     *
     * Let rangeSize be the size of the ranges that each block in the first pass represents.
     *
     * Let blockCount represent the number of blocks in the first pass. Note that arraySize = 2^31 /
     * rangeSize, since there are 2^31 non-negative integers.
     *
     * We need to select a value for rangeSize such that the memory from the first pass (the array) and
     * the second pass (the bit vector) fit.
     *
     * (1) First Pass: The Array
     *
     *     The array in the first pass can fit in 10 megabytes, or roughly 2^23 bytes, of memory. Since
     *     each element in the array is an integer, and an integer is 4 bytes, we can hold an array of
     *     at most about 2^21 elements. So we can derive the following:
     *
     *     blockCount = 2^31 / blockSize <= 2^21
     *                         blockSize >= 2^10
     *
     * (2) Second Pass: The Bit Vector
     *
     *     We need to have enough space to store rangeSize bits. Since we can fit 2^23 bytes in memory,
     *     and thus we have an upper bound for blockSize, which is:
     *
     *     2^10 <= blockSize <= 2^26
