     * We need to prove that at each position i, it can have any element with equal probability.

     * The probability that ith element (including the last one) goes to the first position is 1 / n,
     * because we randomly pick an element in first iteration.

     * The probability that ith element goes to second position can be proven to be 1 / n by dividing it
     * into two cases.
